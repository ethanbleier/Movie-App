# Movie Watchlist

The movie watch list application allows users to log movies they have watched. Users can detail movies by the director, genre, watch-status and their personal rating of the movie. Our app allows users to add, view, edit and delete movies from various lists. 

Admin privileges grant access to the full user database with all permissions enabled.
